Mad Hat Maven is pitching a new AI Orchestration service package to small marketing agencies. The target audience is agency owners and creative directors who feel overwhelmed by AI tools, don't know where to start, and are afraid of falling behind on the technology. The service takes their existing workflows and integrates AI in a way that saves time without replacing their team's voice and judgment. Key differentiator: we don't just hand them tools, we build and run the system for them.
